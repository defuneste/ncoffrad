    "text": "After exploring the MVUM dataset the border between North Carolina and Tennessee looked promising. Unfortunately, many trails appeared to be missing. OpenStreetMap was also not really helpful and it was unclear if the key ATv with value yes or permit was consistent.\nIn the end, I decided to focus on Brown Mountain, even though the available data seemed a bit outdated.\nI used R to process the data and documented the workflow in R/import. With QGIS, I georeferenced the missing trails (using the georeferencer tool with UTM zone 17). The processed data was then exported to the`data/ folder.\nFor publishing, I relied on GitHub and used GitHub Pages to serve the content from the doc/ folder.\nWith more time, I‚Äôd like to expand this into a scrollytelling project that highlights each type of vehicle.\n\n\n\nquarto (quarto render to doc/)\nR (4.5) with package sf, leaflet and htmltools\n\n\n\n\nNC forest service list of trails: https://www.fs.usda.gov/r08/northcarolina/recreation/opportunities/highway-vehicles-ohv\nMVUM: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/motor-vehicle-use-map-roads-feature-layer-7d219\n\n\n\nBrown mountain OHV system: https://www.fs.usda.gov/r08/northcarolina/recreation/brown-mountain-ohv-trail-system"
